Tweetbot is a python library for creating and managing twitter bots, it 
was created to run the @booneweather twitter bot and is still in early
stages of development. See the todo section below for more information.

For a working example check out http://twitter.com/booneweather or clone
the repo http://github.com/zachseifts/booneweather.

## Have ideas on how this could be better or want to help out?

Fork the project on github and push back your changes, I'll include them
in the release. http://github.com/zachseifts/tweetbot
